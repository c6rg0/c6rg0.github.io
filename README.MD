# How to run the website using node.js (localy) - which I will need for my NEA (school project):

1. Make sure that nodejs an npm are installed:
` sudo pacman -S nodejs`
`$ sudo pacman -S npm`

2. Install the http-server package with npm:
`$ sudo npm install -g http-server`

3. Run http-server:
`$ http-server`

And vioala, it works (no need to thank me pal)
